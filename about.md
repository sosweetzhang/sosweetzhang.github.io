## Introduction

I'm an AI researcher who embodies:

- **A Passion for Unraveling, Pioneering, and Illuminating**: Fueled by an insatiable curiosity, I relentlessly explore the uncharted realms of innovative and transformative ideas, and I'm fervently committed to sharing my profound insights with the world.

- **Molding Visions into Reality**: Armed with a robust foundation in systems and engineering, I wield the power to breathe life into abstract concepts, manifesting them into tangible, awe-inspiring solutions. My dedication to the open-source ethos amplifies the impact of my creations.

My research odyssey orbits around:
- **Educational Data Mining**
- **Knowledge Tracing**
- **Student Knowledge Portrait**

In my relentless pursuit of AI excellence, I aspire to not only push the boundaries of these fields but also illuminate new horizons, spark innovation, and forge powerful collaborations that leave an indelible mark on the world.
